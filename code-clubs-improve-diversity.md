# Code Clubs Improve Diversity

## A directory of the UK's minority-specific coding clubs

One of the reasons I love coding is because of the community. There are so many people willing to help beginners get started with coding. If you have benefited from the kindness of others on your coding journey, and want to give something back, then this post is for you! 

Below, I list all the code clubs that I have come across in the UK, and how to help them. If you see any that I have missed, or any links are broken, please let me know in the comments!

### Reasons to help out

In supporting a coding club, you will be helping make the tech industry a better place to be:

- Lend a hand to people from minority groups in tech by sharing your expertise
- Be a positive role model
- Help make your workplace more diverse
- A warm fuzzy feeling from being a nice person :grin:

How about finding some like-minded individuals to help you start your own coding workshop?
